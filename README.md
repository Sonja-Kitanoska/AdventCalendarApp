# Advent Calendar App 🎄

This app is a special gift I created for my kids to make their December mornings more magical. It also served as a fun way for me to practice vanilla JavaScript while developing something meaningful.

The app unlocks one surprise or activity every day in December, bringing joy and excitement to the countdown until Christmas. For times when it’s not December, I included a **demo mode** so you can explore and enjoy the app anytime!

## Features ✨

- **Daily Surprises:** A randomized order of fun advice or activities for kids, unlocked one day at a time during December.
- **Demo Mode:** Try out the app even when it’s not December.
- **Interactive Design:** Enjoy playful colors, sound effects, and animations.
- **Customizable Experience:** Backgrounds and styles designed to bring holiday cheer.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. Each day in December, one new box becomes clickable, revealing a unique activity or advice.
2. Non-December months display a lock screen, but you can activate **demo mode** to preview the app.
3. The app uses vanilla JavaScript for dynamic behavior, making it simple yet engaging.

I’d love to hear your feedback or ideas for making it even better! 😊
